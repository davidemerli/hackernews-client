Follow these steps to configure everything to start developing

### Setup git hooks

Git Hooks are configured in `.githooks` folder. In order to use them you need to set the hooks path to that folder.
You need git version <= 2.29 for that to work.

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Android Studio

At least Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) is needed to work with this project
